Project: Predictive Modeling with Classification

Objective:

This project explored building classification models using a labeled dataset (Titanic Dataset). The aim was to compare the performance of various classification algorithms and identify the most suitable model for predicting passenger survival.

Methodologies used:

• The Titanic-Dataset.csv was loaded using pandas.

• Missing values were addressed using median and mode imputation for numerical features like 
  Age and categorical features like Embarked and Cabin.

• One-hot encoding was applied to categorical features (Sex, Embarked, Cabin) to prepare them 
  for the models.

• The data was split into training and testing sets (80%/20%) using train_test_split.

• Four classification algorithms were implemented: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random 
  Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM)

• Each model was trained on the training data and used to predict survival on the test set.

• Performance metrics were calculated for each model: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score

• The performance metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score) for each model were compared.
  The model with the highest score in each metric was identified as the "best" for that 
  specific criterion.
  
Findings:

• The project successfully implemented and compared four classification algorithms on the 
  Titanic dataset. The performance metrics provided insights into the strengths and weaknesses 
  of each model. By comparing the metrics, the project identified the most suitable algorithm 
  based on the chosen evaluation criteria.
